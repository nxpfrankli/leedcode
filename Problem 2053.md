Title: Thoughts and Solution for LeetCode Problem 2035: Partition Array Into Two Arrays to Minimize Sum Difference

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-two-arrays-to-minimize-sum-difference/description/

Overview: Problem 2035 on LeetCode requires partitioning elements into two separate arrays, A and B, in a way that minimizes the difference in their sums. Array A can be represented with 1 and array B with 0, leading to a permutation visualization of [11110000].

Considering the problem's constraints, the maximum value of N is 15, yielding a total of 30 elements in the combined array (A and B). Calculating the total permutations with the formula 30!/(15!15!) results in an extremely large number, making it inefficient to directly iterate through all possibilities.

Solution Approach:
The goal is to distribute the items so that the sum of elements in array A is as close as possible to the sum of elements in array B. To achieve this, follow these steps:

1. Split the input array into two equal sets, X and Y, with a maximum of 15 items each. Select some items for array A and leave the rest for array B. Each set's total permutation is 2^15.
2. Calculate the sums: Sum(A) = sum(X) + sum(Y) and Sum(B) = SUM(total) - SUM(A).
3. Aim to make sum(A) close to sum(B) by ensuring 2(sum(X) + sum(Y)) is equal to sum(total).
4. For each item chosen from set X, select an item from set Y that is close to the value (sum(total)/2 - sum(X)). By sorting Y's permutation results, only N searches are needed to find the expected value in Y. This leads to a total time complexity of O(N * 2^(N)).

This approach effectively solves LeetCode Problem 2035 by partitioning elements into arrays A and B in a way that minimizes the sum difference between them.

There are multiple ways to generate the permutation set X for array A. One straightforward method involves using binary encoding, in which 1 signifies that an element belongs to the array. The following code demonstrates this approach:

```
int build_half(map<int, vector<int>> &dp, vector<int>& nums, int from, int end)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 1 << (end - from); i++)
    {
        int bits = __builtin_popcount(i);
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < end - from +1; j++)
        {
            if (i & (1 << j))
                sum += nums[from + j];
        }
        dp[bits].push_back(sum);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This function employs binary encoding to generate all possible sums for a given range of elements and stores them in a map dp. The key in the map represents the number of bits set in the binary representation (indicating the quantity of elements in the array A), while the value is a vector containing the all possible sums.

After constructing the dp map for both the first half data (dp1) and the second half data (dp2), we can iterate through all items in dp1 and use binary search to find the corresponding value in dp2. Additionally, it is crucial to consider the number of items in the sets. If there are i items in set X belonging to array A, then there must be N-i items in set Y belonging to array A as well.


```
       for (auto it : dp1)
        {
            int bits = it.first;
            auto s = &(dp2[N / 2 - bits]);
            sort(s->begin(), s->end());

            for (auto j : it.second)
            {
                int a = j;

                auto x1 = lower_bound(s->begin(), s->end(), S / 2 - a);

                if (x1 == s->end())
                    x1--;

                if (abs(S - 2 * (*x1 + a)) < ret)
                    ret = abs(S - 2 * (*x1 + a));

            }
        }
```

The basic method mentioned above can solve the problem. However, we can further optimize the process of building the dp map by using Gray code. Gray code changes only one bit at a time, allowing us to identify the altered bit and add or subtract the corresponding item number without having to iterate through all bits and summing all values again. This improvement results in a faster construction of the dp map.

```
int build_half(map<int, vector<int>>& dp, vector<int>& nums, int from, int end)
    {
        int old = 0;
        int sum = 0;

        dp[0].push_back(0);

        for (int i = 1; i < 1 << (end - from); i++)
        {
            int gray = i ^ (i >> 1);

            int diff = gray ^ old;
            int index = __builtin_ctz(diff);
            old = gray;
            int bits = __builtin_popcount(gray);

            if (gray & (1 << index))
                sum += nums[index + from];
            else
                sum -= nums[index + from];
            dp[bits].push_back(sum);
        }
        return 0;
    }
```
