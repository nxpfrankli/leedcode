Title: Thoughts and Solution for LeetCode Problem 2035: Partition Array Into Two Arrays to Minimize Sum Difference

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-two-arrays-to-minimize-sum-difference/description/

Overview: Problem 2035 on LeetCode requires partitioning elements into two separate arrays, A and B, in a way that minimizes the difference in their sums. Array A can be represented with 1 and array B with 0, leading to a permutation visualization of [11110000].

Considering the problem's constraints, the maximum value of N is 15, yielding a total of 30 elements in the combined array (A and B). Calculating the total permutations with the formula 30!/(15!15!) results in an extremely large number, making it inefficient to directly iterate through all possibilities.

Solution Approach:
The goal is to distribute the items so that the sum of elements in array A is as close as possible to the sum of elements in array B. To achieve this, follow these steps:

1. Split the input array into two equal sets, X and Y, with a maximum of 15 items each. Select some items for array A and leave the rest for array B. Each set's total permutation is 2^15.
2. Calculate the sums: Sum(A) = sum(X) + sum(Y) and Sum(B) = SUM(total) - SUM(A).
3. Aim to make sum(A) close to sum(B) by ensuring 2(sum(X) + sum(Y)) is equal to sum(total).
4. For each item chosen from set X, select an item from set Y that is close to the value (sum(total)/2 - sum(X)). By sorting Y's permutation results, only N searches are needed to find the expected value in Y. This leads to a total time complexity of O(N * 2^(N)).

This approach effectively solves LeetCode Problem 2035 by partitioning elements into arrays A and B in a way that minimizes the sum difference between them.
